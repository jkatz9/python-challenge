# Python Challenge

This repository contains solutions to various Python challenges. The challenges are divided into different projects, each with its own set of requirements and solutions.

## Projects

### PyBank

The PyBank project analyzes financial records to calculate the following:

- Total number of months included in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Average change in "Profit/Losses" between months
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- Greatest decrease in losses (date and amount)

#### Files

- `main.py`: The main script that performs the analysis.
- `Resources/budget_data.csv`: The input dataset.
- `analysis/budget_analysis.txt`: The output file containing the analysis results.

### PyPoll

The PyPoll project analyzes election data to calculate the following:

- Total number of votes cast
- List of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

#### Files

- `main.py`: The main script that performs the analysis.
- `Resources/election_data.csv`: The input dataset.
- `analysis/election_analysis.txt`: The output file containing the analysis results.

## Getting Started

To run the scripts, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
python PyBank/main.py
python PyPoll/main.py
```
